           <b-card-text><p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in 
               Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member 
               of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. 
               NYSL is run by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and 
               previous league members.</p></b-card-text>
