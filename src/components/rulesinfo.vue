      <p> The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice
          the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, 
          administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary 
          action regardless of technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

         <ol>  <li><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong>strong FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensionswithin a given maximum and minimum width and length. 
                            <br>These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older</li>

                          <li><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong>Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which  will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether  or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
 required to play all their games away.</li>

                          <li><strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</strong>

                                  <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas.<br> Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
                                  <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                                  <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
                                  <li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal dimensions <br>and size of goal similarly modified.</li>

          Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be retained after the match by the referee. The pass of any individual who has received a third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
